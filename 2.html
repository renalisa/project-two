      <h3>What makes Hatch green chile special?</h3>
      <p>
        Hatch chile is chile grown in the Hatch Valley in southern New Mexico.
        The village of Hatch is known as the chile captial of the world, and
        produces some of the most flavorful chiles in the world. The area, close
        to the Rio Grande, is nutrient rich, and the farmers, many of whom have
        been there for generations, are experts in the art of growing chiles.
        For your own hatch chile experience, visit the annual Hatch Chile
        Festival held near the end of august, find products in your grocery
        store, or have products shipped to you!
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is the difference between red and green chile? Which is hotter?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Red and green chile are the same plant, the only difference is the
        length to which they are let mature. Green chile is picked first, often
        around August or September, depending on the harvest. Red chile is
        picked later, near the end of the season, when the chiles on the plants
        are firmer. Red chiles are made into ristras around Christmas, which are
        the wreaths made of chiles you will see around the southwest. The spice
        level between red and green chile depends on the day, the restaurant,
        and the cook in the kitchen. Typically green is hotter because the plant
        gets sweeter as it matures, however, one can never be sure. Can't decide
        between red or green? Just order "Christmas".

      <h3>How can I roast my own chile?</h3>
      <p>
        There are many opportunities to roast your own chile in New Mexico. Many
        farms, like Big Jim Farms in Albuquerque, allow you to pick your chile
        from their fields, and then they will roast the chile for you in the
        chile roaster. The chile roaster is a large mesh cylindrical bin that
        rotates either automatically or by hand, fueled usually by a propane
        tank beneath it. Roasting in this bin can take around 10 minutes. To
        roast chiles at home, simply pop them on the grill or wrap them in foil
        and stick them in a broiler oven. Cook until charred. You can peel the
        chile right away, the inside should feel a bit slimy. Or, store the
        chile in the freezer with the skins on and save for later.
