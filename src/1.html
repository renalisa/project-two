      <h2>Our Furry Friends, the Prairie Dogs</h2>
      <p>
        Up in the Valles Caldera, about 80 miles north of Albuquerque, prairie
        dogs reign. The wide-open short-grass prairies are perfect habitat for
        the hundreds of colonies of prairie dogs that live there. There, you can
        hear them chattering to each other, darting into their labyrinths and
        popping back up to stand tall (14 inches) over the plains.

      <p>
        The scene for prairie dogs in Albuquerque, however, is a bit less
        idyllic. The highways, development lots, construction, and buildings
        have displaced prairie dogs and forced them to become urban dwellers.
        Our concrete jungle endangers the prairie dogs. At the same time, their
        presence can at times be a nuisance and a traffic hazard. Which is where
        Prairie Dog Pals comes in. When Liz Green and Ana Davidson saw hundreds
        of misplaced prairie dogs on Tramway Boulevard in the 1980s, they were
        compelled to do something. Green and Davidson began by feeding prairie
        dogs where their natural food sources had been eliminated. They also
        advocated against the use of poison on prairie dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges these conservationists have faced is the
        public perception of prairie dogs, says president Yvonne Boudreaux. To
        many people, the desert dogs are pests that disrupt baseball practice,
        18-hole golf rounds, or even the backyard. While they may occassionally
        disrupt our human habits, prairie dogs are a critical part of the
        ecosystem. Inhumane methods of removing them and extensive development
        threaens them, and as a keystone species, our desert ecosystem rests
        partially on their shoulders. Keystone species are species ecosystems
        depend on heavily to function. Prairie dog burrows attract other animals
        like burrowing owls, coyotes, raptors, and the endangered black-footed
        ferret. According to Davidson’s research, “The dramatic decline in
        prairie dogs has resulted in consequent losses in associated species and
        grassland habitat.” In a nutshell, the prairie dogs aren’t pests, they
        help form the glue that keeps the central grasslands together.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how does one actually rescue the little critters that are so good at
        chirping at you, then darting back into their hobbit homes? The answer?
        “Bubble-ology,” jokes Boudreaux. Prairie Dog Pals has been officially
        helping our desert friends since they became a 501(c)3 non-profit in
        1991 and they operate as a well-oiled machine. For larger sites, the
        team uses “flushing” which involves a mixture of water and non-toxic,
        biodegradable soap. A large water tank churns the mixture creating a
        “lighter than cotton candy foam and we put that down the burrow and we
        wait there, on hands and knees, and wait for a prairie dog to emerge,”
        says Boudreaux. The team tries to rescue prairie dogs in family groups.
        When they poke their small bodies out, someone grabs them around the
        shoulder blades with fingers under their armpits. The team does a quick
        health check on every prairie dog, ensuring their eyes are clear, teeth
        are straight,and all toes are accounted for. The team is also prepared
        to do first aid for bites or cuts, and has a veterinarian that is
        willing to take on more serious injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Prairie Dog Pals has a mission to rescue all prairie dogs, not just
        larger colonies. They respond to calls for individual dogs as well, at
        no cost to you. “We’ve always made it our policy as well that we would
        go get singles wherever they turn up,” explains Boudreaux. Such a policy
        keeps the dogs from being targeted by less humane practices. That even
        goes for prairie dogs that are outside of Albuquerque, outside of New
        Mexico, or even outside the Southwest. According to Bourdreaux, Prairie
        Dog Pals has also “made it our policy from the beginning that if any pet
        trade prairie dog turns up and needs to be rescued that we would go get
        it.” This means that if a student going off to college has a prairie dog
        she can’t take, someone from Prairie Dog Pals will drive up to
        Washington D.C. or Washington State to fetch it. And yes, they have done
        just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides bad PR surrounding prairie dogs, perhaps the next biggest
        challenge for the Pals is finding land that fits their ecosystem. In
        fact, despite Prairie Dog Pal’s commitment to saving individual dogs or
        dogs that are out of their way, Boudreaux reports that they cannot
        rescue dogs in northern New Mexico because the ecosystem is too
        different. For any calls they might get from Taos or Los Alamos, they
        refer people to an associate in Santa Fe. Further, any land that does
        fit the local prairie dogs’ ecological needs has its own carrying
        capacity. Prairie Dog Pals is cautious of overcrowding their
        land—otherwise they could end up doing more harm than good to their
        precious pups and the rest of the ecosystem. In their top season,
        Prairie Dog Pals rescued about 2,000 dogs. However, Boudreaux says that
        their success is really demonstrated by decreasing numbers across
        seasons. The fewer rescues they make per season, the more prairie dogs
        have been permanently relocated to healthier, safer land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prairie Dog Pals accept volunteers and donations. But regardless of your
        formal affiliation with the group, everybody can be a prairie dog pal by
        recognizing the pups’critical place in our desert.
